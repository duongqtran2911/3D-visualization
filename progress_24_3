Progress report 2: (24/3)

I am having having difficulties in the following aspects: setting up the first person view, 
designing the 3D space, and figuring out the connections of classes and objects to put them into the GUI.
My biggest problem is about how to design the first person view and put it to the GUI.

There has been almost nothing really completed, and I am truly concerned about my project, but I will just keep trying.
I also have more time to spend into the project now thanks to the quarantine.
