Progress report 1:
I have tried implementing some different graphics library but results have been not very encouraging. 
I will continue with the Scala Swing library and maybe also Java Swing library. 
I am encountering mathematical problems when calculating the dimensions of the objects before putting it in the GUI,
  which is quite the key point of the project.

=> I am lagging behind my schedule presented, but I will try my best to accelerate and keep it up in time.
